I'm writing to follow up on my email from last month. I will be meeting with my board of advisors next week. We are in the process of closing files for the current term. Typically, when I've made contact, and l havenâ€™t heard back after about a month, it means they are really busy or aren't interested. If you aren't interested do I have your permission to close your file?

If you are still interested, what do you recommend as a next step?

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
